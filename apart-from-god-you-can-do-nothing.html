    <br/>
    <p>If you remain in me and i in you, you will bear much fruit; John 5:19 so jesus explained, “i tell you the truth, the son can do nothing by himself. The son can do nothing of himself. as the outcome of that entire dependence, he could add:</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Abide In Me, And I In You.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jesus is the vine and we are the branches (john 15:5). But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness. 6 if anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers;</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>During His Time On Earth, Jesus Often Spoke In Parables, Or Used Analogies.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Have we found ourselves not being fruitful in god&#039;s kingdom? You are not walking according to my will, but your own. He does only what he sees the father doing.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>John 1:3 God Created Everything Through Him, And Nothing Was Created Except Through Him.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>We may think we are so wonderful and able to do amazing things. Apart from me you can do nothing.” this statement of jesus (john 15) is right in the middle of chapters fourteen and sixteen. If you remain in me and i in you, you will bear much fruit;</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>When Jesus Said, Ask The Father Anything In My Name And He Will Give It To You (John 16:23), He Did Not Intend For This To Be A License To Treat God.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>I have been putting pressure on many to make them see the foolishness of trying in their own strength to be holy. Every person is created unique, with different characteristics, skills, and abilities. Those who remain in me, and i in them, will produce much fruit.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>You Can Bear Fruit Only If You Abide In Me.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>“i am the vine, you are the branches: Apart from jesus, you can do nothing. He who remains in me, and i in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Apart From Me You Can Do Nothing.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Or, you may have read this phrase during leadership or evangelism training, urging your frequent communication with jesus. In everything the life of the branch is to be the exact counterpart of that of the vine. When jesus says apart from me you can do nothing he means if you&#039;re not joined to me, you can&#039;t bear any fruit.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Such Branches Are Picked Up, Thrown Into The Fire And Burned.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Apart from him, there is no hope. He that abideth in me and i in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing. “there is no such thing as a great man of god, only weak, pitiful, faithless men and a great and merciful god.”.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>I Am The Vine, Ye Are The Branches:</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The fruit that jesus is talking about is of (at least) two kinds. For without me, you can do nothing.” john 15:5 “i can do anything through christ which strengthens me.” phil 4:13. If a man remains in me and i in him, he will bear much fruit;</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>He That Abideth In Me And I In Him, The Same Bringeth Forth Much Fruit:</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>First, there&#039;s the fruit of the spirit: He who remains in me, and i in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>“Good Pride” Is Recognizing That Apart From God, You Can Do Nothing ( John 15:5 ), And, Therefore, Giving God The Glory For The Things You Accomplish.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If you’re not abiding, you’re not doing god’s work. For apart from me ye can do nothing. Whoever abides in me and i in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>All That The Father Doeth, Doeth The Son Also Likewise.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>He who continues in me and in whom i continue bears abundant fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. Apart from my grace, you can do nothing. The consensus of the ancient versions in favour of the first person, i said, instead of thou hast said (the italicised words o my soul, are a mere gloss from the chaldee), gives for psalm 16:2 the plain and intelligible rendering.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>It Sure Seems Like We Do Things Apart From Jesus.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Perhaps you’ve heard that no one can do anything apart from jesus. Of himself jesus had said: He cuts off the branches that never bear any fruit because they do not abide in him (john 15:6).</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Apart From Me, You Can Do Nothing.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>It is the man who shares my life and whose life i share who proves fruitful.for apart from me you can do nothing at all (emphasis ours throughout). “apart from me, you can do nothing.” so says the lord jesus (john 15:5). #5 “apart from me you can do nothing.” the works we do when we are not connected to the source, jesus christ, are works of the flesh, and even the ones that seem like they are for god will be proven to be selfish and empty at the judgment (1 cor 3:15).</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Apart From God, We Can Do Nothing.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>1 john 4:9b (esv) god sent his only son into the world, so that we might live through him. Jeremiah 10:23 i know, o lord, that the way of man is not in. Jn 15:5 “i am the vine;</p>

    <br/>
    <p>Whoever abides in me and i in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. Apart from him, we are alienated. Jesus is blunt to say the least.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>The Fact That God Ultimately Controls The World And Has The Power To Destroy Us Or Do Whatever He Wants</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jesus said, “i will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (matthew 16:18)… apart from jesus we can do nothing… but he can bear much fruit in and through us… Apart from my grace, you cannot do any good thing. World english bible i am the vine.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>But If You Live Your Life In Me, And My Words Live In Your Hearts, You Can Ask For Whatever You Like And It Will [Be Done] For You.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Jesus&#039; quote by myself i can do nothing in john 5:30 (how much more so can we do nothing) i am the vine; Nothing to right our own wrongs. I am the vine, you are the branches.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Apart From Him, We Are Walking Through Life Without God.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>He that abideth in me, and i in him, the same beareth much fruit: “remain in me, and i will remain in you. If you don’t abide in me, you won’t bear fruit.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Whatever The Father Does, The Son Also Does.”.</b></h3>
    <br/>
