        No, nonrefundable deposits are illegal. If only 1 roommate is moving out and the person moving out paid the deposit to another roommate, that roommate has to return the deposit. Security deposits are used when renting property to save the landlord from having to spend time and money bringing legal action to receive money for repairing or replacing the leased property.
    </p>
    <h3>When Does My Landlord Have to Return My Security Deposit</h3>
    <p>When the lease is terminated the landlord must return the remaining security deposit and write a security deposit refund letter. If you will not be refunding any or all the security deposit, you need to send a letter to your tenant’s new address explaining why, along with any remaining security deposit money. If you have not received your refund in the time allotted (up to 60 days), write a letter requesting your refund. Can i get my security deposit back if i never signed a lease?</p>
