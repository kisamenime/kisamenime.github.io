    <p><strong>Apartment Complex Won T Fix Ac</strong>. I&#039;ve found several things needing repairs. Nrs 118a.290 defines habitability of a dwelling unit and includes air conditioning (as long as the unit had air conditioning when leased) as a habitability issue.</p>

        <p>
        The implied warrant of habitability would apply here, and in the hotter regions of the u.s., landlords are going to be required to fix air conditioner problems within a reasonable amount of time. If your lease specifically mentions that the apartment is air conditioned or comes with an air conditioner, then the landlord must ensure that the unit works properly. You must notify your landlord before you try to move out, hire someone to repair your ac or rent a hotel room with the expectation of reimbursement.

    <p>Check your local court for the escrow process. According to the north carolina attorney generalâ€™s office, landlords are required to repair and maintain heating, air conditioning, plumbing. I moved into the residence in september of 2020, so about 8 months now. I moved into this house in january of &#039;08.</p>

    <p>If the air conditioning were to fail at your apartment complex, you, your management team and the maintenance crew would have an emergency on your hands. That is a really complicated issue. If your landlord insists that he won&#039;t fix the air conditioner, you still have other options, but you should get proper legal advice before you proceed.</p>

    <p>After giving landlord written notice of a problem, you can begin paying your rent into escrow with your local court on time each month, and the landlord will have to go to court and explain what is being done to fix the problem, if the lease requires landlord to fix and maintain the ac. Keep the receipt and mail it along with a notice to your landlord that you will be deducting the repair cost from your next rent payment.
