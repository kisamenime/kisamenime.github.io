    <br/>
    <p>Before patching up the paint job, you want the wall surface to be as smooth and blemish free as possible to help the paint blend. At corners, the walls, even when painted at the exact same time with the exact same paint, will look like different colors because of the angle at which the light is hitting them.

        <h3 class="h6"><b>Or Ask Them If They Have The Paint Code So You Can It To The Store And Get Some.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Don’t pass up their important (and free) advice.
