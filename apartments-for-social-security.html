    <h3>Low Housing for Seniors on Social Security HUD</h3>
    <p>While social security disability housing assistance often comes in the form of benefits payments, there is no such thing as social security disability.

We will spend over £3 billion to deliver at least 50,000 affordable homes, of which 35,000 will be for social rent, by march 2021. The housing facilities focus and check eligibility of the people who are 55 to 62 years old.</p>
