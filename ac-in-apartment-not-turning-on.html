        Look for your home&#039;s central air conditioner power supply and make sure all the switches are turned on. For this reason, one of the most common questions we get from homeowners is whether or not they can save money by turning their ac on and off when it is and isn’t in use. For many that means air conditioning, but it you live in an apartment building where the landlord has control over that you may be waiting a bit for some ac.

    <h3>AC unit/filter in my apartment is frozen solid anyone know</h3>
    <p>The reason your air conditioner won&#039;t turn on could be because the condensate drain line is clogged. If it’s clogged with dirt or other debris, you won’t get any air flow. In either case, the attention and care of your air conditioner contractor is needed to restore service. These are not common issues if the electrical wiring is done well, but when they happen, they should be attended to by a trained electrician.</p>
