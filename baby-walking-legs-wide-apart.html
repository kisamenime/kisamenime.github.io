    <p>Hip stiffness affects the baby&#039;s ability to get up onto the knees the stiffness in the hip muscles affects the infants ability to get up into kneeling or onto all fours. In any case, your midwife will routinely check the stability of your baby&#039;s hips soon after they are born, spreading their legs wide apart, bending and unbending their legs. This position affects the infant&#039;s ability to balance, reach sideways and twist the trunk. Emg (neuromuscular studies) of children with 6 months of walking experience have also shown that they will fire their outer hip muscles (specifically the muscles that outwardly rotate their legs, and that move their legs apart) for stability.</p>

    <p>They keep their hips and knees slightly bent and land flat footed without an arch in their foot. A child is considered bowlegged when his/her knees are wide apart or do not come together when standing with their feet and ankles together. Bowed legs (genu varum) is a condition in which a person’s knees stay wide apart when they stand with their feet and ankles together.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Infants Who Move Like This Always Sit With The Same Foot In Front.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>They move forwards by vigorously rocking the pelvis forwards and backwards and bouncing on their buttocks. Newborn to two months from birth, your baby has the reflexes needed to stand, by bracing her legs against a surface she feels under her feet (sharma and cockerill 2014). In any case, your midwife will routinely check the stability of your baby&#039;s hips soon after they are born, spreading their legs wide apart, bending and unbending their legs.</p>
        <h3 class="h6"><b>Nude Woman Reclining On Blanket On Beach.jpg.</b></h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The legs are held wide apart when they are on their tummies and this makes it difficult to get up onto the hands and knees in readiness for crawling. Kids who are learning to walk are called toddlers because that&#039;s exactly what they do — they toddle, keeping their legs wide apart and seeming to hesitate between each step, jerking from side to side as they move one foot forward, then the next. Emg (neuromuscular studies) of children with 6 months of walking experience have also shown that they will fire their outer hip muscles (specifically the muscles that outwardly rotate their legs, and that move their legs apart) for stability.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>They will continue to have feet far apart to increase their base of support and their hips wide and rotated outwards with their arms out to the side. That&#039;s a condition caused by, among other things, a lack of vitamin d and calcium in your baby&#039;s diet that inhibits bone growth. Coming to whether or not an infant can get bowlegs by standing too early, scientific studies suggest that infants who stand or walk early get predisposed to a medical condition called blount’s disease which is a disorder of the legs in which a lot of pressure is put on the physis above the tibia resulting in the tibia of the child growing abnormally and the child.</p>
